Visualization of the current snow water storage situation in mountainous Central Asia

This repository contains the code to visualize the current snow water storage situation in mountainous Central Asia. The snow data is obtained from the [snomapperForecast](https://github.com/joelfiddes/snowmapperForecast) model deployed by [@joelfiddes](https://github.com/joelfiddes/), Swiss Federal Institute of Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF) on an AWS instance. The snow model is an operational version of [TopoPyScale](https://github.com/ArcticSnow/TopoPyScale) which runs the [Factorial Snow Model (FSM)](https://github.com/RichardEssery/FSM).

The deployed version of the app is available here: [snowmapper.ch](https://snowmapper.ch).
